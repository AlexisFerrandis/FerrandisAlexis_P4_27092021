## Fourth project with Openclassrooms

The objective of this project was to optimize an already existing website. For that, it was important to:

-   Provide an SEO analysis report of the site, in which we clearly identify 10 priority recommendations;
-   The complete source code of the improved site;
-   An optimization report including a comparison of the results (including loading speed and accessibility).

## Lighthouse results

## Recommendations application

### Accessibility

-   Use a contrast analysis tool to re-evaluate it, modify the colors to clearly differentiate the text from the background.
    (A contrast ratio of 4.5: 1 for normal texts)
    (A contrast with a ratio of 3: 1 for large texts).

-   Choose a suitable font size to make it easier to read.

-   Make sure that all the content is available on the page thanks to the style.

-   Be careful about the style overlay, which can sometimes lead to a loss of content.

-   Harmonize the pages to obtain a coherent content, here, implement the same Navbar as on the home page to limit this kind of problem for example.

-   It is important to support the user in entering a form through:
    (colored, text, icons, entertainment...). In addition, the input fields must be identifiable via their labels.

### Accessibility & SEO

-   Encourage the use of text when possible, this will make it more accessible and improve the performance of the site.

-   The purpose of the alt attribute, and of any alt text, is to describe the element to which it is attached. It is important both for a user and for the search engine robots that will crawl the page.

-   Provide sensible page titles that will make navigation easier. These titles will be the first item visible on search engines, so they need to be fine-tuned.

-   Specify the language of the site, here <html lang = "fr">

-   It is important to optimize the meta description tag, it must be concise, precise, and integrate the main keywords of the page and of the subject's semantic field.

-   Using semantic tags in a relevant way, they will simplify the organization of the code as a whole, but also promote reading by e-readers and crawl robots.

-   The text of a link should provide information on its return, here "Contact" would be a more adequate text.

-   It is essential to bring a hierarchy to the titles.
    -> A title h1
    -> Followed by two or three h2
    -> Themselves followed by several h3
    -> And so on.

-   50% of visitors are on mobile and Google now uses the mobile version of a site as the main version for its index, its optimization is crucial.

### SEO

-   Choose images that have a size comparable to the div to which they are attached and compress them as much as possible.

-   Keywords should be used wisely. In the description tag where they will have a primary role, then in the titles, paragraphs or alt when it is consistent.

-   Links are important in increasing the authority of the site, but they should be selected sparingly. (By obtaining quality links from other sites, creating partnerships, using a diverse panel)

-   Google Analytics allows you to obtain information about visitors to your site, such as their number, the medium they use (desktop vs mobile), the pages they have visited, etc. It is essential to follow the evolution of SEO on a regular basis.

-   Minify files to remove unnecessary characters and make them lighter.

-   By compressing with Gzip, it is possible to considerably reduce the loading time of the site. It is one of the most efficient compression methods, reducing response time by up to 70%.
