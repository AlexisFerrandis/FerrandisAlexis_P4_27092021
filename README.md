## Fourth project with Openclassrooms

The objective of this project was to optimize an already existing website. For that, it was important to:

-   Provide an SEO analysis report of the site, in which we clearly identify 10 priority recommendations;
-   The complete source code of the improved site;
-   An optimization report including a comparison of the results (including loading speed and accessibility).
